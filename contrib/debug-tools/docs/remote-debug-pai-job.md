# 1. Overview

OpenPai remote debug tool only support python job. It contains two debug mode:

1. Start remote debug when job starts
2. Inject breakpoint in source code and start debug when hit the breakpoint.

Currently this feature is in experiment phrase, and we don't have a mechanism to notify user weather debug server is starts. Users need to check log to my theirself to get this notification.
